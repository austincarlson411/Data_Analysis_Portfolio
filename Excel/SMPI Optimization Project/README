#SMPI Optimization Project

For this project I worked with my supervisor to build statements to minimize cross references and speed up generation. 
Before changes time to generate lists took 90 - 120 minutes. After changes time to generate lists took 1-2 minutes. 
This lead to year time cost savings of almost 1000$
